# Steam-sale-tracker-repo
## User Story
```md
As a frugal game user
I want an easy, friendly and more streamline website
So that I can easily track which game goes on sale based upon the genre search.
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would be a lot more user friendly than the current webpage has to offer. Being advocate gamer who struggles to find game as a cheaper price, majority of the user will look to PoweredSteam, which sells video games online. However, the problems in which user faces are the website itself. The page is complicated and overflowed with information that can deter users from looking any further. AS they aim to only look for game that are on sale without scrolling or clicking on mutiple path to find what they are looking for, we aim to quickly solve that problem. Using HTML, JavaScript, Css and Apis, we look to build a website that allows users directly to find game at a cheaper price based on the genre that they are looking for. 

This solves the need of an individual who doens't have time to shift through endless data or someone with out a lot of computer experince to find what they are looking for.
