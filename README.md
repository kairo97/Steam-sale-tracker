# Steam-sale-tracker-repo
## User Story
```md
As a frugal game user
I want an easy, friendly and more streamline website
So that I can easily track which game goes on sale.
```
## Description
The motivation behind this project was to create an application that would be more user friendly than what the current webpage has to offer. Being an advocate gamer who struggles to find games at a cheaper price, a majority of the userbase will look to SteamPowered, which sells video games online. However, the problems in which user faces are the website itself. The page is complicated and overflowed with information that can deter users from looking any further. As users aim to only look for games that are on sale without scrolling or clicking on multiple paths to find what they are looking for, we aim to quickly solve that problem. Using HTML, JavaScript, Css and Apis, we look to build a website that allows users directly to find games at a cheaper price. 

This solves the need of an individual who doens't have time to shift through endless data or someone without a lot of computer experince to find what they are looking for. 

## Acceptance Criteria
```md

```

## My Task
To create a functional and streamline game sales website that can fetch raw data for users based upon the price of game they are searching for. 

## Installation
Begin at the GitHub repository that holds the code:
<!-- Insert github URL -->

Once you are at the correct repository, click on the green "<> Code" button and select "SSH" under the "Local" tab.

Copy the SSH key to your clipboard and navigate to your terminal.

Once you are in your terminal, navigate to the directory of which you would like to clone this repository.

When you are at the destination you would like to clone, follow through with the git cloning procedures as you would normally.

For Windows: git clone "key that was copied to your clipboard" --> Enter

## Usage
When arriving at the website, users will be presented with a several options for games based on price, as well as a single button. Once clicked, the user will be shown a video game at a discounted price. The user will also be shown a recent news story. Both of these items will have a link directing users to their respective destinations. If the user clicks the button again, they will be shown another discounted game.
